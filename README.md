# Preferences-App
This is a simple app that shows you how to keep the state of a variable regardless of where you navigate to or if you restart it.

I made the application during the Flutter Udemy course, it is simple and I did it with help, 
but maybe it will help someone else and if I need to do something similar, I can use this app.
